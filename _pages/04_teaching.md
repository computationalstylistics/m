Apart from my regular university courses – which are not covered on this page yet – I enjoy teaching workshops and other extra-curricular courses at different summer schools, conferences, and so forth. These include, at the first place, the following annual (or biannual) events:

* [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](http://www.dhsi.org/index.php) (DHSI) in Victoria BC, Canada.
* [The European Summer University “Culture & Technology”](http://www.culingtec.uni-leipzig.de/ESU_C_T/node/97) (ESU) in Leipzig, Germany.
* [GIAT-IQLA Summer School in Quantitative Analysis of Textual Data](http://www.giat.org/?page_id=11&lang=en) in Padova, Italy.
