The research projects conducted by the [Computational Stylistics Group](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/) members can be described broadly as computer-assisted text analysis, or text-centric Digital Humanities. They include the [package ‘stylo’]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/stylo/), the [Rolling Stylometry]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/rolling_stylo/) method, and [Bootstrap Consensus Networks]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/networks/) which were briefly covered elsewhere on this website, but also a few other research projects that I’ve been involved in. Below, I give a super-compact list of them – please follow the links to see more comprehensive descriptions:



* [Foundations of Computational Stylistics](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/focs/), a 5-year project founded by the National Science Centre (SONATA-BIS 2017/26/E/HS2/01019), carried out at the Institute of Polish Language (Polish Academy of Sciences). It is aimed to develop, evaluate and apply an innovative methodology of comparing large texts collections, in order to identify hidden patterns and similarities invisible to the naked eye.

* A series of papers on [stylometric methodology](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/methodology/), including a study on minimal sample size (Eder 2015a) and its follow-up (Eder 2017b), on the strength of the authorial signal in correlation with different vectors of frequent words (Rybicki and Eder 2011), on appropriate choice of texts for the training set in machine-learning classification techniques (Eder and Rybicki 2013), on systematic errors in authorship attribution (Eder 2013), and so forth.

* A study on the [authorship of _The Polish Chronicle_](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/gallus-anonymous/) traditionally ascribed to Gallus Anonymous, in which I corroborate the “Venetian” hypothesis formulated by Tomasz Jasiński: stylometric evidence seems to confirm that the author of the _Chronicle_ and the Monk of Lido is one and the same person (Eder 2015b, 2017a).

* [Grammatical and lexical changes in the history of the Polish language](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/chronology/), a 3-year project, founded by the National Science Centre (OPUS 2013/11/B/HS2/02795), is aimed at an investigation of grammatical and lexical changes, focusing on trends and dynamics of changes in the middle and modern Polish period. One of the deliverables is the monograph _Zmiana w języku. Studia kwantytatywno-korpusowe_ (more on this study: [here](http://maciejeder.org/projects/language-change/)).

* A study on [Elena Ferrante as a virtual author](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/elena-ferrante/), in which the aim was to corroborate recent rumours that the actual person under the acclaimed pseudonym is in fact Domenico Starnone, a Neapolitan writer (Eder 2018). However, I wanted to ask a slightly different question, namely whether a (skilled) writer can develop two distinct authorial voices: What if there are in fact two personae in one writer, the actual Starnone and a virtual “Ferrante”?

* [Harper Lee and other people](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/blog/harper-lee/)
is a study on stylometric evidence in two novels by Lee: the Pulitzer Prize winning _To Kill a Mockingbird_ (1961) and _Go Set A Watchman_ (2015), sometimes claimed to be written (or at least heavily edited) by Truman Capote. What we find is no evidence of Capote but some obscure stylistic idiosyncrasies in the climactic chapter of the _Mockingbird_ (Choiński et al. 2019).
